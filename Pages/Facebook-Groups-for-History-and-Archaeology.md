[Diggers with Kids (For Parents Working in Archaeology & Heritage)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2192638950961613/)

    Digger’s with Kids is a supportive space for archaeologists and heritage professionals with families. The plan is to bring together people going through similar experiences as we “grow up” as a profession. Together we can make this a site where we have a place to chat about issues which specifically affect those of us with children and caring responsibilities – and to offer help and support to others.
